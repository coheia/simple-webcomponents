Proof of concept of a structure to automate the processes of development, documentation and distribution of webcomponents, designed to serve a Desgin System, or a UI Library which follows the principles of [Component Driven UI](https://www.componentdriven.org/), being built from the bottom up.

## Develop
```console
git clone git@github.com:coheia/simple-webcomponents.git
cd simple-webcomponents
yarn
yarn dev
```

Access [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/)
